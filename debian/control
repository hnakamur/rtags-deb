Description: C/C++ code indexer, completion and navigation daemon 
 RTags is a client/server application that indexes C/C++ code and keeps a
 persistent file-based database of references, declarations, definitions,
 symbolnames etc. There’s also limited support for ObjC/ObjC++. It allows you to
 find symbols by name (including nested class and namespace scope). Most
 importantly we give you proper follow-symbol and find-references support. We
 also have neat little things like rename-symbol, integration with clang’s
 “fixits” (http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html). We also integrate with
 flymake using clang’s vastly superior errors and warnings. Since RTags
 constantly will reindex “dirty” files you get live updates of compiler errors
 and warnings. Since we already know how to compile your sources we have a way
 to quickly bring up the preprocessed output of the current source file in a
 buffer.
